## Hi, welcome to my git! :potted_plant:

- I'm a Ph.D. student at Upenn ESE, working on motion planning, with the supervision of Professor Vijay Kumar.
- My research interests are:
  - (Multi-agent) Task and motion planning
  - (Learning-enabled) Trajectory generation and optimization
  - Aerial robot applications (exploration, tracking, navigation)
- I welcome collaboration if:
  - You are interested in exploring research topics, particularly in planning.
  - You are a Penn student looking to pursue an independent study or thesis under my guidance.
  
### Open-Source

I am passionate about open sourcing to benefit the entire robotics community.

#### under construction (in this order I will work on it)

- [kr_opt_sfc](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_opt_sfc): A tool to find optimal convex cover to approximate collision-free space
- [kr_param_yaw](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_param_yaw): A trajectory optimization method with global yaw parameterization


#### 1. Motion planning 

- [AllocNet](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/AllocNet): A lightweight learning-based trajectory optimization framework.
- [forces_resilient_planner](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/forces_resilient_planner): A systematic framework for local planning under external disturbance.

#### 2. Environment representation


#### 3. Simulation and benchmarks

- [kr_mp_design](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_mp_design): A guidance for the design and evaluation of motion planners for quadrotors
- [kr_param_map](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_param_map): A parameterized map generator for planning evaluations and benchmarking

#### 4. More collaboration works 

- [SEER](https://github.com/tyuezhan/SEER): Safe Efficient Exploration for Aerial Robots using Learning to Predict Information Gain
- [DZone_Tracking](https://github.com/Zhourobotics/DZone_Tracking): A risk-aware multi-agent target tracking framework with sensing and communication danger zones
- [resilient-target-tracking](https://github.com/Zhourobotics/resilient-target-tracking): A resilient and adaptive multi-robot target tracking framework with sensing and communication danger zones
- [drl_lc_exploration](https://github.com/M4D-SC1ENTIST/drl_lc_exploration): A multi-agent cooperative exploration in sparse landmark complex environments

## Hi, welcome to my git! :potted_plant:


- I'm a Ph.D. student at UPenn ESE, working on motion planning for robots, with the supervision of Professor Vijay Kumar.
- My research interests are:
  - (Multi-agent) Task and motion planning
  - (Learning-enabled) Trajectory generation and optimization
  - Aerial robot applications (exploration, tracking, navigation)
- I welcome collaboration if:
  - You are interested in exploring research topics, particularly in trajectory planning.
  - You are a Penn student looking to pursue an independent study or thesis under my guidance.
  
### Open-Source

I am passionate about open sourcing to benefit the entire robotics community.

#### 1. Motion planning 

- [AllocNet](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/AllocNet): A lightweight learning-based trajectory optimization framework. (ROS1)
- [forces_resilient_planner](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/forces_resilient_planner): A systematic framework for local planning under external disturbance. (ROS1)

#### 2. Environment representation

- [kr_opt_sfc](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_opt_sfc): A tool to find optimal convex cover to approximate collision-free space.

#### 3. Simulation and benchmarks

- [kr_mp_design](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_mp_design): A guidance for the design and evaluation of motion planners for quadrotors
- [kr_param_map](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_param_map): A parameterized map generator for planning evaluations and benchmarking (ROS1 & ROS2 compatible)

#### 4. More collaboration works

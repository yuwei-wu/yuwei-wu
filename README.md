### Hi, welcome to my git!

:sparkles: Let's explore something interesting together~

#### üçÉ Current Status

- Now I'm working on motion planning, with the supervision of Professor Vijay Kumar at the University of Pennsylvania.
- Before it, I worked with Professor Fei Gao, at Fast lab, Zhejiang University (ZJU). Many cool guys here are sincerely interested in research and focus on developing quadrotors in various aspects (mechanic, electrical, and algorithmic areas) I really admire and thank them for leading me to the world of quadrotors!

####  :notes: About Me

- I'm a 2nd year master student at Upenn, majoring in Systems Engineering. 
Actually, my major is transportation engineering during my undergraduate study.
I SWITCH to ESE because I am interested in looking deeper into the field of autonomous systems, not only the high-level planning or management of the whole system. 
*My brother also majors in autonomous control at ZJU and now an algorithm engineer about NLP lol.

- The profile picture is my hand-drawn. üå∏ Inspired by comedies and cartoons, I enjoy painting in leisure time.
#### üçÇ Lifelong Goal ... 

- Robotic scientist! I wish I can do research and make contributions to this field throughout my whole life. 
I'm convinced that robots can change our life and improve the development of society.

#### üí¨ Q&A

- I'm open to any discussions~ feel free to contact me!

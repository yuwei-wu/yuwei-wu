# Hi, welcome to my git!

## 1. Introduction

- I'm a Ph.D. student at Upenn ESE, working on motion planning, with the supervision of Professor Vijay Kumar. Before that, I worked with Professor Fei Gao, at Fast Lab, Zhejiang University (ZJU).
- My research interests are:
  - (Multi-agent) Task and motion planning
  - (Learning-enabled) Trajectory generation and optimization
  - Aerial robot applications (exploration, tracking, navigation)


## 2. Open-Source

I am passionate about open sourcing to benefit the entire robotics community.

### under construction (in this order I will work on it)

- [kr_opt_sfc](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_opt_sfc): A tool to find optimal convex cover to approximate collision-free space
- [kr_param_yaw](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_param_yaw): A trajectory optimization method with global yaw parameterization


### 2.1 Motion planning 

- [AllocNet](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/AllocNet): A lightweight learning-based trajectory optimization framework.
- [forces_resilient_planner](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/forces_resilient_planner): A systematic framework to achieve robust local planning, which accounts for the influence of extreme external disturbance.

### 2.2 Environment representation


### 2.3 Simulation and benchmarks

- [kr_mp_design](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_mp_design): A guidance for the design and evaluation of motion planners for quadrotors in Environments with Varying Complexities
- [kr_param_map](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_param_map): A parameterized map generator for planning evaluations and benchmarking


### 2.3 More collaboration works 

- [SEER](https://github.com/tyuezhan/SEER): Safe Efficient Exploration for Aerial Robots using Learning to Predict Information Gain
- [DZone_Tracking](https://github.com/Zhourobotics/DZone_Tracking): A risk-aware multi-agent target tracking framework with sensing and communication danger zones
- [drl_lc_exploration](https://github.com/M4D-SC1ENTIST/drl_lc_exploration): A multi-agent cooperative exploration in sparse landmark complex environments


## 3. Collaboration 

"I welcome collaboration if:

- You are interested in exploring research topics, particularly in planning.
- You are a Penn student looking to pursue an independent study or thesis under my guidance."
